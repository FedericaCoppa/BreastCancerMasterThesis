# High-Resolution Image Segmentation and Classification in Breast Cancer Screening

The aim of the project consists in presenting and analyzing the efficiency of an additional instrument in the fight against breast cancer: artificial intelligence and, more specifically, deep learning. Due to the fact that breast cancer is one of the major causes of death among women, many solutions to this problem have been proposed. However, artificial intelligence represents a foremost help for radiologists. In particular two approaches are analyzed: image classification and, in a second moment due to some problems related to image classification, pixel segmentation. This second method will give as a result fondamental information that, combined with the work of experts can improve the prevention of breast cancer.
